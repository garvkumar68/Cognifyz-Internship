# Cognifyz Technologies – Machine Learning Internship
**December 2024 – January 2025**

---

This repository contains my internship work at **Cognifyz Technologies** as a **Machine Learning and Data Science Intern**.  
During this period, I worked on various projects involving **data analysis**, **machine learning models**, **recommendation systems**, **classification tasks**, and **location-based visualization**.

## 📋 Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Task 1 – Predict Restaurant Ratings
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to discover feature relationships using **correlation heatmaps** and **associations**.
- Built a **Random Forest Regressor** and **LightGBM** model for predicting restaurant ratings.
- **Model evaluation metrics achieved:**
  - **MAE**: 0.2011  
  - **MSE**: 0.0940  
  - **RMSE**: 0.3063
- Identified **LightGBM** as the best-performing model using **PyCaret’s compare_models()**.

<br>

### 🔹 Task 2 – Restaurant Recommendation System
- Built an **interactive recommendation system** based on:
  - **Currency selection**
  - **City selection**
  - **Cuisine selection**
- Implemented **dynamic filtering**, sorting by **aggregate ratings** and **average cost**, to recommend the **Top 10 restaurants** to the user.

<br>

### 🔹 Task 3 – Cuisine Classification
- Developed a **Cuisine Classification** model using a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Preprocessed the dataset with **Label Encoding**.
- Achieved **high accuracy** on the test set.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**

<br>

### 🔹 Task 4 – Location-Based Analysis
- Created a **Geospatial Visualization** using **Folium**.
- Mapped restaurant locations by **latitude** and **longitude**.
- Visualized:
  - **Number of restaurants per city**
  - **Average ratings**
  - **Average price range**
- Built **interactive HTML maps** highlighting key restaurant metrics.
